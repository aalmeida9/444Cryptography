# 16 character key/ciphertext

# discard every 8th bit of key so 14 bits?

# Start DES
# Initial Permutation function on plain text

# Initial permutation produces two halves; Left and right
# Each half goes through 16 rounds of Encryption
# ultimately havles are rejoined and a final permutation is done on the combined block
